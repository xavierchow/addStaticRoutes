# addStaticRoutes
A script for adding static routes on Mac OS X.

If you are using v\*p\*n but want to bypass it for local/domestic networks,
then this script is just what you're looking for.

**NOTE:**

1. *sudo* is needed for executing.
2. The addresses in the script are Chinese domestic networks with [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation.
Feel free to change them.
